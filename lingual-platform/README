How to run unit tests in Eclipse

When you will try to execute a unit test in eclipse, the test framework will complain that 
cascading-local or cascading-hadoop is missing:

"add cascading-local, cascading-hadoop, and/or external planner library to the test classpath"

To solve this problem, we need to add the artifacts of cascading-local as test dependencies

    <dependency>
      <groupId>cascading</groupId>
      <artifactId>cascading-local</artifactId>
      <version>${cascading.version}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>cascading</groupId>
      <artifactId>cascading-local</artifactId>
      <version>${cascading.version}</version>
      <classifier>tests</classifier>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency> 

You need also to add the lingual-local project as runtime depdnency when running the test. For this,
you need to go in the run configuration of the unit test, and add the lingual-local project
in the classpath.
